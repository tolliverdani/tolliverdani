## Planned and/or on-going Individual Projects
- The good ol' personal / portfolio website
- Redesigning a website I dislike
  - I really just wanted a reason to practice using Python/Django because in our course for Web Dev we used Javascript and React/Node
  - The inspiration for this website is coming from other competitors and new website's best practices
- Light-weight charitable giving app
  - This idea was inspired by my time searching for an out-of-the-box solution for a charitable giving software provider at my previous job
  - The scope of this light-weight MVP includes:
    - Set up a connection to ProPublica's API
    - Create a db schema to store employee information
    - Search for non-profits by EIN
    - Filter eligibility criteria
    - Record employee transactions
    - Output monthly "invoices"
- Wikipedia Geolocation city explorer
  - I got this idea while I was traveling in Spain and looking for audio guides - why not harness data from Wikipedia to generate city-specific guides
  - The scope of this project includes:
    - Connect to wikipedia's geosearch
    - Create a db schema to store user information
    - Map list of locations onto a google maps API
    - Enable users to click through to articles from the map
    - Enable a read functionality
