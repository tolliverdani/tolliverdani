# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my github profile! Iâ€™m @tolliverdani

I'm a current MSCS student at Northeastern University in Boston and I'm looking to showcase my background and some of my projects. So far I've learned these programming languages: Java, SQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python, R, C++, and C.

## Project Highlights
- [Timber](https://github.com/lilyguibessette/Timber), Mobile App Development
  - Developed an Android app with Java in a team of 3 to connect general contractors and homeowners
  - Led the UX/UI efforts with an emphasis on prototyping, layouts, custom styles, and app notifications
  - Implemented GPS-based matching, tinder swiping mechanism, and an in-app messenger built on Firebase
- PubMed Database, Database Management Systems
  - Designed and implemented a relational database with R and SQL that reads publication data in XML format and parses it into a database, allowing users to query on the data and run an analysis
  - Designed the database schema with UMLs, connected to an AWS RDS, and built fact tables
- Easy Animator, Object Oriented Design
  - Developed an app with Java that reads and converts a text file into instructions to play an animation
  - Designed the app using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture
  - Implemented graphics, animation, and GUI controls (play, pause, remove shapes)

## Favorite Courses (so far)
- Web Development (in progress) - CSS/HTML & JavaScript & React
- Mobile App Development - Android/Java
- Database Management Systems - SQL & R
- Object-Oriented Design - Java

In the coming months I plan on contributing to open source projects, and adding more side projects to my portfolio so hit me up if you'd like to collaborate on anything.
